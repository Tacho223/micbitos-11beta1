This is a Beta for my tiny Operating system for the Microbit, the startup screen isn`t ready yet, but i`m working on it.
You need to Hook up an VGA port like this:
r goes to P0
g goes to P1
b goes to P2
HSYNC goes to P12
VSYNC goes to P16
an PS/2 Keyboard interface is planned, and will be includet in the nxt Beta.
You can hit the "a" button to Trigg an Bluescreen.

Enjoy ;)
